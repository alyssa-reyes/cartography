            <h2>Academic Interests and Goals</h2>
            <p>My academic interests include ecology, geospatial science, environmental conservation, and environmental studies. I graduated from Cal Poly Humboldt in December of 2023. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology with an emphasis in Ecology. I hope to use the geospatial skills and knowledge I learned at Cal Poly Humboldt in conjunction with my biology knowledge to address anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I am a highly skilled individual with a wealth of experience in customer service, research, and transportation. I currently work at Cal Poly Humboldt as a shuttle driver, where I make sure that staff and students are transported in a safe and dependable manner with a particular emphasis on helping people who have mobility impairments. In order to guarantee operational effectiveness and safety, I take pride in keeping track of schedules, instructing student drivers, and managing vehicle maintenance. My ability to communicate well with a variety of groups and my comfort working in a variety of weather conditions have contributed to my development of great customer service skills.</p>

            <p>Previously, I worked as a seasonal park assistant at Palomar Mountain State Park and as a research assistant at Azusa Pacific University. In these roles, I did fieldwork, engaged with the public, and supported environmental education initiatives. In addition, I oversaw employees and improved the visitor experience while working as a Lead Guest Ambassador at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. I graduated from Cal Poly Humboldt with a bachelor's degree in biology with an emphasis on ecology, and I have a strong interest in environmental science, research, and community involvement.</p>
