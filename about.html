            <h2>Academic Interests and Goals</h2>
            <p>My academic interests include ecology, geospatial science, enviornmental conservation, and environmental studies. I graduated from Cal Poly Humboldt in December of 2023. 
                I earned a Bachedlors of Science in Biology with an emphasis in Ecology. I hope to use the geosptatial skills and knowledge I learned at Cal Poly Humboldt in conjunction with my biology knowledge to 
            address anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems. </p>
